- I want to develop a communication platform to bring people with different political views together to have a civilized conversation 
using positive reinforcement instead of sanctions, as social media works today. Sanctions such as exclusion, stage denial, cancellation, etc. 
either performed by the users themselves or moderators. 

- The consequence of this is that people seek out groups that think the same as themselves and in this way form echo chambers. This is very negative for society 
that people stop talking to each other if they are ethically and politically too far apart. When you stop talking to each other, you develop unnecessary nagative 
views of each other and you stop listening to what the other party is saying and start putting negative labels on each other.
